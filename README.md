# Allow2php

todo: Port https://github.com/Allow2/Allow2node to a PHP library
(NOTE: Allow2WP wordpress plugin has an embedded implementation, so we can use that to extract the necessary parts into the library, but then also should have that plugin leverage this library - tease it out)

Oh, and we should build this library to be easy to install via composer, packagist, etc
